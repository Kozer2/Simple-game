            <p>Ben is a current student at DeltaV code school in Cedar Rapids Iowa.
            One night while in the shower the idea <br> for this simple game came to him and so he decided to just make it happen.
            He was quite tired when he started <br>on this as his Fiance wouldn't let him go to bed because he still had to take the dogs out, <br>but he couldn't take them out too early or they'd wake up early in the morning asking to go out.</br></p>
